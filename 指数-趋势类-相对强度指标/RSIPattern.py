# relative strength index(rsi) is another popular indicator for technical analysis
# actually i believe its kinda bull shit
# normally i read stuff on trading view wiki
# its not like i work there and try to promote it
# trading view wiki is a very detailed encyclopedia for different indicators
# plz refer to the following link for more details
# https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Relative_Strength_Index_(RSI)

# on trading view wiki, there are a couple of strategies to use rsi
# the simplest one is overbought/oversold
# that is what this script is about
# we just set upper/lower boundaries capped at 30/70 for rsi
# if rsi exceeds the bound, we bet the stock would go under price correction

# another one is called divergence
# rsi goes up and price actually goes down
# the inventor of rsi called wilder believes bearish rsi divergence creates a selling opportunity
# but his protege cardwell believes bearish divergence only occurs in a bullish trend
# so their ideas basically contradict to each other
# i would undoubtedly give up on this bs divergence strategy

# the last one is called failure swing
# its kinda like a double bottom pattern in price itself
# except this strategy is a pattern recognition on rsi
# since i have written bottom w pattern for bollinger bands
# i would not do it here
