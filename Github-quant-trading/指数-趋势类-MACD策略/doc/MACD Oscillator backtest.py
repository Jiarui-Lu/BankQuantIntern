#signal generation
#when the short moving average is larger than long moving average, we long and hold
#when the short moving average is smaller than long moving average, we clear positions
#the logic behind this is that the momentum has more impact on short moving average
#we can subtract short moving average from long moving average
#the difference between is sometimes positive, it sometimes becomes negative
#thats why it is named as moving average converge/diverge oscillator
